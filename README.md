# Tinder For Cats

The same as [Tinder For Bananas](https://tinderforbananas.com/), but for cats!
The [original üçå code](https://github.com/surma/tinderforbananas.com) is from [Surma](https://twitter.com/DasSurma).

This page uses images from [This Cat Does Not Exist](https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/), and random profiles from [Twitter Bio Generator](https://www.twitterbiogenerator.com/generate).

If you like cats, why not considering [adopting one](https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+shelters+near+me)?
